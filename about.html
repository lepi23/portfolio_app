          <p>
            I was born and raised in Tampere Finland and being always interested
            in technology, computers and computer programs, it is not a surprise
            that I ended studying software engineering at the University of
            tampere.<br />
            I am currently on my fifth year at the University and about to start
            writing my master thesis. I am also trying to start my career as a
            software engineer. My ambition is to become a front-end or fullstack
            developer as I have found a great interest in developing web
            applications.

            I was in a project group that was developing a prototype of a centralized patient monitoring system. 
            My responsibilities were to implement the back-end for the application using technologies such as Node.js and socket.io. 
            I was also responsible for the system testing of the product.
